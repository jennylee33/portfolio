           <li>WHAT IS A LIFE COACH?</li><br>
          <li>Life coaching or a life coach is the term that initially gained popularity when the field of coaching emerged. Today there are many more types of coaching, for example a transformational coach or performance coach, is a person who helps facilitate effective change and personal growth by inspiring and guiding you toward:
            
            
            
            Unleashing your unlimited potential,
            Challenging and helping you breakthrough your limiting beliefs,
            Uncovering your aspirations, dreams and goals in life, and
            Support you in the necessary actions you need to take to achieve them.</li><br>
            <li> WHAT DOES A LIFE COACH DO?</li><br>
           <LI>So, what does a life coach do? The main aim of a life coach is to uncover the obstacles that are holding you back from accomplishing your goals or being fulfilled in life and selecting the best course of action to help you live the life you desire.
            
            Life coaching refers to the equal partnership between you and the coach. You become a team. As the client, you verbalise your feelings and get your worries out in the open, and your transformational coach helps you integrate it and make sense of it all, free from judgement while providing guidance when you need it.
            
            Together you will uncover and eliminate negative thinking patterns and destructive behaviours that are preventing you from reaching your goals.</li><br>
            
            <li>WHO NEEDS A LIFE COACH?</li><br>
            If you’re experiencing one of the 3 scenarios below, then you might want to find a performance coach to help you through it:
            
            You’re stuck, feeling unable to move or break free from any number of things, like a career or life you hate. You feel lost, uncertain of how to get unstuck and move to a place of happiness and fulfillment. This type of situation is frequently characterized by feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.
            You recently got out of a relationship or gotten divorced. Starting over is both beautiful and frightening. Working with a life coach can help you re-discover the real you and help you avoid making the same mistakes in your next relationships.
            You feel frustrated with life and believe you’re meant to do more and accomplish more. You want to change your life but don’t know where to start. A performance coach provides you with the guidance you need to make the necessary changes so you can rise to your full potential.</li>
